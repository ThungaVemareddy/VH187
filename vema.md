Problem it solves: priorly detecting deformed wing virus helps to prevent death of honeybees and it leads to growth of productions.


use cases:Disease Monitoring
          Research and Surveillance
          Environmental Monitoring


challenges we ran into:Imbalanced Data
                       Model Generalization
                       Deployment and Integration






TITLE: Identifying Honeybee Wing Viral Deformities
Building a web application and using a TensorFlow model to identify malformed wings in honeybees.


Members of the team: UMMADISHETTY VISHNU SAI, KOMMULA VENU GOPAL

Problem it solves: Early identification of the deformed wing virus in honeybees helps to lower death rates of honey beesÂ and increases yields of output.

Applications/use cases: Research and Surveillance, Disease Monitoring
Environmental Observation

challenges we ran into:Imbalances Data Model Generalization, Deployment, and Integration Challenges
